The importance of frameworks that aid people’s critical thinking in a pandemic
==============================================================================

I’m writing this post on Sunday, 21 of February 2021. The current state
of the world is not so great. We are amid a pandemic that has taken so
far 2.46 Million lives globally. I want to communicate in this post
about the urge for **software tools that aid people in critical thinking
regarding information received**. The amount of misinformation shared
about COVID-19 has raised concerns in the public authorities on a global
scale. Social media platforms’ usage aggravates the problem; the freedom
of speech and reaches to the masses that these platforms provide enables
spreading the “disease” of misinformation. This problem is not exclusive
to the COVID-19 pandemic, but all controversial things. Social media
platforms allow individuals, some public figures, to share their best
interest opinions for the masses to follow. **The urge for frameworks
that detect, understand and expose COVID-19-related misinformation.**

The [World Health Organization (WHO)](https://www.who.int/) has coined
the term **infodemic**. An infodemic is an “overabundance of information
– some accurate and some not – that occurs during an epidemic. It can
lead to confusion and ultimately mistrust in governments and public
health response.” Elected officials like [Donald Trump’s
presidency](https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/donald-trump-biggest-driver-of-covid-19-misinformation-study-1.5130505)
lead to mistrust in the USA government. Trump plays a critical part in
spreading false information. In his presidency, he trivialized the risks
of COVID-19 by comparing it to seasonal influenza, contradicting public
health experts, and questioning the vaccine development essential to
population wellness. WHO suggests creating tools that help people
[**find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need
it.**](https://www.jmir.org/2020/6/e19659/)

A tool for finding trustworthy sources could be a **well-defined
framework** that people can utilize to challenge the information
consumed. The process of gauging the validity of data during a pandemic
is known as [**Infodemic
management**](https://www.who.int/teams/risk-communication/infodemic-management).
The term means *“applying evidence-based interventions that bring
understandable, localized evidence-based information to citizens and
drive positive health-seeking behaviour.”* [A framework for infodemic
management](https://www.jmir.org/2020/6/e19659/) that the WHO has
recommended is the following:

1.  Interventions and messages must be base on science and evidence.
    They must reach citizens and enable them to make informed decisions
    on protecting themselves and their communities in a health emergency
2.  Knowledge should be translated into actionable behaviour-change
    messages, presented in ways that are understood by and accessible to
    all individuals in all parts of all societies
3.  Governments should reach out to crucial communities to ensure their
    concerns and information needs are understood, tailoring advice and
    messages to address the audiences they represent
4.  To strengthen the analysis and amplification of information impact,
    strategic partnerships should be formed across all sectors,
    including but not limited to the social media and technology
    sectors, academia, and civil society
5.  Health authorities should ensure that these actions are informed by
    reliable information that helps them understand the circulating
    narratives and changes in information flow, questions, and
    misinformation in communities.
6.  Infodemic management approaches should be further developed to
    support preparedness and response, inform risk mitigation, and
    enhance data science, socio-behavioural, and other research.

The widespread usage of social media is a significant influence on
people’s thought processes. As [Tristan Harris
explained,](https://www.wired.com/story/our-minds-have-been-hijacked-by-our-phones-tristan-harris-wants-to-rescue-them/)
social media platforms’ best interest is to **retain their users’
attention** for the longest, and all platforms compete for our
attention. The incentive of maintaining attention on the application
means that the algorithms for content suggestion would prioritize
content that engages the user the most, but **not the content that would
benefit the user the most.** This content suggestion mechanism is
problematic due to the possibility of transmission of misinformation to
the user. Misinformation is of utmost concern to the WHO as it claims
that *“The right message at the right time from the right messenger
through the right medium can save lives - misinformation or mixed
messages can cost lives.”* As users of these social media platforms, we
must use these applications with a grain of salt. Recognize the choices
engineers made when engineering these applications how they feed our
attention. We must critically think about what kind of information we
are consuming.

The efforts to combat the infodemic are no only made by the people at
WHO. Experts in Liverpool, England, have developed a software tool that
teaches people how to think critically. Inspired by the current
infodemic, researchers create a **chatbot** that *“based on the work of
some of philosophy's greatest critical thinkers, to help improve
people's ability to spot semi-fake news.”* The chatbot teaches by giving
examples of the rationale used by three philosophers (Aristotle,
Socrates and Gorgias) to deduct whether or not the information present
is real or its semi-fake. Researchers hope with the help of the chatbot,
*"people will develop critical thinking that strengthens their digital
literacy and helps them and their communities become more resilient to
information manipulation with our chatbot.”* The Fake News Immunity
Chatbot seeks to combat the proliferation of misinformation by helping
the general public build “fake news immunity.”
